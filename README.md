## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Main Configuration (`config/shared_config.lua`)

```lua
Config.Locale = "en" -- Language setting

-- Art pieces that can be stolen
Config.ArtHeistProps = {
    "p_gen_statue02b",        -- Large statue
    "p_cherubstatuenbx01x",   -- Cherub statue  
    "p_headbust03x"           -- Head bust
}

-- Theft mechanics
Config.CutHandsChance = 0.9           -- Chance to cut hands during theft
Config.CutHandsDamage = 10            -- Damage taken when cutting hands
Config.DeleteLockPickChance = 0.9     -- Chance lockpick breaks
Config.StatueDamage = math.random(1, 100) -- Random damage to stolen art
Config.StealProgBarDuration = math.random(15000, 30000) -- Theft duration

-- Delivery locations with NPC dealers
Config.DeliveryLocations = {
    [1] = {
        name = "Saint Denis Dealer",
        coords = {x = 2705.594, y = -1105.877, z = 48.415, h = 219.542},
        pedModel = "mp_de_u_m_m_aurorabasin_01",
        pedName = "Aurora Basin",
        isScam = true,        -- This dealer might scam players
        scamChance = 0.9,     -- 90% chance to scam
        offers = {
            ["p_gen_statue02b"] = { minPrice = 1200, maxPrice = 4800 },
            ["p_cherubstatuenbx01x"] = { minPrice = 800, maxPrice = 2500 },
            ["p_headbust03x"] = { minPrice = 500, maxPrice = 1300 },
        }
    },
}
```

### Prop Positioning (`config/shared_config.lua`)
Configure how art pieces attach to player hands:

```lua
Config.PropsLocationOnHands = {
    ["p_gen_statue02b"] = {
        x = 0.8, y = 0.8, z = -0.4,
        xRot = 45.0, yRot = -45.00, zRot = 0.0,
    },
    -- Add more configurations for different art pieces
}
```

## üéØ Commands

### Player Commands

/attachtestprop       # Spawn a test art piece (for testing)
```

## üåç Localization

The script supports multiple languages. Edit `config/locale.lua` to add translations:

```lua
Locales = {
    ["en"] = {
        ["getOffer"] = "Get Offer For",
        ["steal"] = "Stealing...",
        ["pickup"] = "Pickup",
        ["putDown"] = "Put Down",
        ["cutyourhand"] = "You cut your hands.",
        ["statueDamaged"] = "The statue was damaged, its value decreased.",
        ["missingitem"] = "You are missing the lockpick",
        -- Add more translations
    },
    ["tr"] = {
        -- Turkish translations
    }
}
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Adding New Art Pieces
1. Add the prop name to `Config.ArtHeistProps`
2. Configure hand positioning in `Config.PropsLocationOnHands`
3. Add pricing to dealer offers
4. Add UI images if needed

### Adding New Dealers
```lua
[2] = {
    name = "Valentine Dealer",
    coords = {x = -175.0, y = 627.0, z = 114.0, h = 180.0},
    pedModel = "a_m_m_unidustrial_01",
    pedName = "John Smith",
    isScam = false,
    scamChance = 0.0,
    offers = {
        ["p_gen_statue02b"] = { minPrice = 2000, maxPrice = 5000 },
    }
},
```

### Customizing Damage System
- Modify `Config.StatueDamage` for different damage ranges
- Adjust `Config.CutHandsChance` for injury probability
- Change `Config.StealProgBarDuration` for theft timing

## üé® UI Customization

The React-based UI can be customized by editing files in the `web/src` directory:

- `components/App.tsx` - Main UI component
- `index.css` - Styling and animations
- `assets/` - UI images and fonts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Art pieces not spawning:**
- Check if prop names in config match game assets
- Verify server has proper prop streaming

**Lockpicks not working:**
- Ensure `cas_fwlibs` is properly installed
- Check inventory system compatibility

**UI not showing:**
- Verify React build is up to date
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure NUI callbacks are registered

**Dealers not responding:**
- Check NPC spawn coordinates
- Verify ped models exist in game
- Ensure proper framework integration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode in config:
```lua
Config.Debug = true
```
